          <h1>Stylus Emporium Museum – Jewellery Quarter</h1>
          <p>Immerse yourself in the history of the 19th Century Pen Trade. Discover the tough working conditions of women working in the pen factories. Experience writing with feather quills, reeds and steel pen nibs.
            The Stylus Emporium Museum focuses on the important legacy of Birmingham’s 19th Century pen trade and its significant contribution to improving literacy throughout the world. It’s located in a former pen factory, built in 1863, where
            visitors experience writing with feather quills, reeds and steel nibs and can also make their own nib using traditional methods. Birmingham dominated the world’s production of steel pens in the mid to late 19th century, which, had a
            significant impact on improving literacy on a global basis. It has been estimated that the City produced approximately three quarters of the world’s pens in the mid to late 19th century. Explore the collection of over 5,000 objects
            related to the Birmingham Pen Trade. Our team is also happy to answer (where possible) general questions about pens.</p>

          <p><b>We still need support. </b><br>As a charity, we totally depend on our dedicated, experienced and loyal team of volunteers along with the generosity of donors and supporters. Our wonderful visitors also provide regular income to help
            keep this part of Birmingham’s
            important heritage alive.

            Being the world’s only museum dedicated to the history of Birmingham’s steel pen trade and its global impact, we narrate an important part of Birmingham’s industrial development.

            Birmingham dominated the world’s production of steel pens in the mid to late 19th century, which, had a significant impact on improving literacy on a global basis. It has been estimated that the City produced approximately three quarters
            of the world’s pens in the mid to late 19th century.

            But it is more than a museum, it’s also a place of discovery and inspiration through our displays, activities and events.

            Our aim is to engage and inspire visitors, provide Outreach in terms of history, deliver writing skills workshops with a new focus on digitising part of our collection and archive to increase public engagement and accessibility to as wide
            an audience as possible.</p>

            <p><b>Fundraising Appeal</b> Our heartfelt thanks go out to every one of our generous Crowdfunding supporters who helped us raise an amazing £6,163 in just 41 days. We will be in touch in due course as well with all those generous
              supporters who also selected a reward with their donation. Whilst we have been fortunate to receive a short term revenue grant from the Arts Council England plus the continued generous responses to our Crowdfunding appeal, we are
              unfortunately far from out of the woods. We are awaiting government guidance on the opening of Museums but either way, even when we do reopen (with the necessary safety measures in place) we realise it will be a considerable time before
              visitor numbers reach pre crisis levels. However, we are now confident, that given the fantastic response to our appeal, that we will ride the crisis and keep the history of the Steel Pen Trade and its importance to Birmingham alive for
              future generations to enjoy. Thank you, once again from everybody at the Pen Museum. Crowdfunder project page is still available for donations to be made to support our work.</p>
